<h1 style="color: white;padding-bottom: -80px">Corona Virus/COVID-19</h1>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.</p>

	<h2 style="background-color:#b1cbbb;text-align: center; padding: 10px 20px"> FAQ Regarding COVID-19 </h2>
		
<button class="accordion">Q1.How is corona virus spread?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).

COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Q2.Can I get Covid-19 from my pet and other animals?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread COVID-19 to people or that they might be a source of infection.

Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.

However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Q3.Who is at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:
<ul>
<li>People aged 65 years and older</li>
<li>People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility</li>
<li>People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:</li>
<li>People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma</li>
<li>People who are immunocompromised</li>
<li>Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications</li>
<li>People with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥40)</li>
<li>People with diabetes</li>
<li>People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis</li>
<li>People with liver disease</li>
</ul>

</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Q4.Where can i get tested for COVID-19?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider. State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Q5.What does more severe illness mean?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your body’s function.  You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Q6.What is community spread?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.</p>
</div>
